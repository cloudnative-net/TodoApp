# Why this repository? 

This repository houses a .NET Core 3.1 Web API built to teach Cloud native app development. Along the way, we also learn sustainable development practices

# Patterns and practices being taught

1. Building an application that follows [The Twelve-factor](https://12factor.net/) principles
2. Packaged as a Docker container
3. Hosted on AWS (to begin with) with infrastructure provisioned through code (IaC)
4. Continuous integration, Continuous deployment and delivery (CI CD) using Github Actions

## Distributed, loosely coupled systems architecture

Modern, cloud native applications do not exist on an island. An application exists as part of an ecosystem to solve a business problem.
We will also learn how to build applications that integrate with the ecosystem in a loosely coupled manner using an event-driven architecture
